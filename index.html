    <div id="quote">"I own a missile for homeland defense, since that's what Woodrow Willson intended. Four bandits break into my air space. "Scramble, scramble" As I grab my helmet and AIM-9X Sidewinder. Blow a soft ball sized hole through the first bandit, he's dead on the spot. Draw my AMRAAM on the second man, miss him entirely because he notched it and it pitbulls on a civilian airliner. I have to resort to the Patriot missile system mounted at the airbase below, "Tally ho lads" the surface-to-air missile shreds two men in the blast, the sound and falling metal set off car alarms. I then resort to dogfight the last bandit. Select my M61 Vulcan 20mm, pull him into HUD and fire. He bleeds out in the cockpit waiting for ejection because 20mm high-explosive is impossible to stitch up. Just as I get a Bingo fuel warning."</div>
